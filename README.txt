If you have the hardware, connect the usb cable to the hardware and then to the computer or any other voltage source.
After that, run the jar file, wait for bluetooth to connect. You want to hook up the device similarly like any other FIE fencing equipment
Use the three prong cables and connect it to the unit on each side. You should have two - three prong cables for each side. Each of those cables have a plug that goes
to the sabre and the other is a clip that attaches to the metal of the armor of the same user. Perform those attachments. 

After all that is done, press start on the machine and it will allow you to hit the opponent to do damage.

If you do not have hardware, just run the jar, it will try to connect to bluetooth but will fail. If you press start from there
the simulator will run and you can test the program.
